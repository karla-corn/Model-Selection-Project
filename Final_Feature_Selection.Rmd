# Introduction

Byssinosis, also known as Monday fever, is a lung disease, caused by
inhalation of cotton and other vegetable fibers. CDC has estimated that
during the early 70s in the U.S. 20% of cotton workers were evidenced to
have byssinosis. In modern days, employers are advised to improve
ventilation and provide staff with respiratory protection. In this
assignment, we are diving back in time to a 1974 North Carolina cotton
factory, in order to explore the dataset and build a logistic regression
model with Byssinosis. Our primary goal is to outline risk factors and
discover the effects of intersectionality on Byssinosis diagnosis.
\newline

# Data

The data is provided through the STA138 course on Canvas, in the .csv
wide format. It consists of 5,418 observations (employees), with 6
categorical variables: Employment Length, Smoking, Sex, Race, Workplace
dustiness level, and Diagnosis of Byssinosis. Variables such as Smoking,
Sex, Race, and Diagnosis of Byssinosis are Bernoulli variables, and
Employment Length with Workplace dustiness are Multinomial variables,
with 3 classification categories each. Since they are categorical,the
distribution of each variable has been visualized through pie charts
(Figures 1 - 6). In this data set, employees with Byssinosis represent
only 3% of the overall population, which is the response variable for
our prediction modeling, meaning that in this population
$P(Byssinosis) = 0.03$. Some other distributions of interest are
Workplace levels: 1 making up 12.35%, level 2 at 24%, and level 3
dustiness with 63.65%. The sex distribution of employees is nearly
$50/50$, with race being categorized at 64.88% as white and 35.12% as
other. Distribution of smokers is also nearly $50/50$, which is not
surprising for 1970â€™s. Finally, workers employed for under 10 years make
up 50.37% of the sample, those working 10-19 years are 13.14% and
employees above 20 years are 36.49%. \newline

\newpage
Additionally, we created contingency tables for Byssinosis and each of
the right-hand variables and used the Chi-Squared test to find which
groups Byssinosis was dependent on. Workplace resulted in the highest
X-statistic of 413.71, suggesting that the probability of Byssinosis is
heavily dependent on how dusty the workplace is. Sex, Smoking,
Employment, and Race, had X-statistics of 37.66, 19.355, 10.177, and
5.804 respectively, which all suggest dependence at a 0.05 significance
level.

# Methodology

The given was already cleaned, but required re-formatting from wide to
long. This was done with the intention of randomly spitting observations
into an 80% training (ntrain = 4334) and 20% testing (ntest= 1084) sets.
We also re-formatted Employment so we could have a clean, numeric
factor; the new indexing for this variable: 1 = less than 10 years, 2=
10-19 years and 3 = over 19 years of employment at the cotton factory.
Since every variable is categorical, quadratic terms will not be
included, because they are unidentified, and therefore do not contribute
towards the model. This leaves us with a linear additive model and usage
of interaction terms. Due to the size of our group, we split into AIC
and BIC approaches for binomial and poisson regressions, which allowed
us to examine the data from different angles and compare the criteria
using an identical training set. Poisson regression was selected as a
model due to the skewed distribution of Byssinosis, following the
convergence of Binomial distribution to Poisson when p is small (.03)
and n is large (5,418). We began the process using forward stepwise
regression, starting with an empty model and then comparing its fit
using AIC or BIC to each additive term or interaction, stopping the
process when the AIC or BIC stopped decreasing. \newline

## Model Selection

### Stepwise Regression Under AIC

AIC has a factor of $k=2(p+1)$, where $p+1$ is the number of parameters
added to the deviance of the models which accounts for small complexity.
It was applied first because BIC always prefers a simpler model, and we
needed to observe the possible complexity of the output before
simplification. To fit our models using AIC we did forward stepwise
regression starting with the first model including only each individual
variable: Employment, Smoking, Sex, Race, Workspace or None. From this
step we concluded that Workspace leads to a better model, so we
continued including Workspace as a variable in our model. Then, we
proceeded to include the rest of the variables as additive terms and
concluded Smoking is also a factor. Afterward, we compared to other
additive variables and concluded Employment is also a factor, but race
and sex have no significant relation to Byssinosis. Then, we considered
interactions between Workspace and Employment, Workspace and Smoking,
and Employment and Smoking. We concluded that there is an interaction
between Workspace and Employment but not with Smoking. We obtain the
following model:

$$y = -2.0839 - 0.9618x_1 + 0.8687x_2 + 0.4814x_3 - 0.3445x_4$$

Where, $x_1$ represents workspace which takes on values 1-3 to represent
dustiness (very dusty, somewhat dusty, not dusty). $x_2$ represents
employment which takes on values 1-3 to represent years employed at
their place of work (\<10, 10-19, \>19). $x_3$ represents smoking which
takes on values 0 or 1 to represent whether or not someone smokes. $x_4$
represents the interaction of workspace and employment, increasing the
risk of angina conditionally on the increased dustines and length of
employment together.

### Interpretation and application

Since Workplace and Employment factors cannot be omitted (theyâ€™re never
0), the base model in our logistic regression model relies on the
non-smoking status of the workers. To clarify the impact of the
variable, by holding Workplace and Employment constant, we found the
odds ratio of byssinosis in a smoker v.s. non-smoker to be 1.618. Our
discovery points to an increased chance of lung disease in smokers,
keeping all other terms constant.

Since our data converges to Poisson Distribution, we conducted the same
steps above under a Poisson Regression model and found similar results.
Except we found sex to be a factor and this model included no
interactions. Our final model under Poisson is:

$$y = -2.0552 - 0.9697x_1 + 0.7237x_2 + 0.4379x_3 - 0.2871x_4$$

Where, $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, $x_4$ are the same as under Logistic
Regression.

## Stepwise Regression Under BIC

We followed a similar process under BIC, but BIC considers complexity in
terms of the data size by adding a factor or $k = log(n)$ where n is the
sample size of our training data which is 4,334. We started with the
simplest models and compared the BIC of single variables, we concluded
that Workspace is a factor. Here we tried other additive terms but
concluded that Workspace as a single factor gives the best model.

Our final model is:

$$y = -0.2298 -1.5762x_1$$

Where $x_i$ is the different types of workspace which takes on values
1-3 to represent dustiness (very dusty, somewhat dusty, not dusty).

Under Poisson, we get a similar model with $y = -0.4573 -1.4940x_1$

### Interpretation and application

Unlike the model fitted using AIC, this model prioritizes simplicity and
thus omits terms that do not make large improvements in making
predictions. As a result, the odds ratio of Byssinosis between workers
is determined by their Workspace only.

## Using Residuals

We decided to see the residuals in our model to note anything out of the
ordinary, but since residual plots can be ambiguous we do not get any
new information. We can see that both models have deviance residuals
generally close to 0. The deviations present in their curves are not
significant enough to suggest poor model fit.

Since we split the data, we want to test our model into the new data.
Since under both Poisson and Binomial Distribution we got a similar
model under AIC and BIC, we decided we would choose one distribution for
prediction. We used logistic regression under Binomial distribution to
classify the data. Then, we used confusion matrices to evaluate how
accurate our models are at predicting Byssinosis. Having a high accuracy
would indicate having a reliable model for making predictions. In these
tables, having class = 0 means not having Byssinosis, while class = 1
means having Byssinosis. Both models have the same accuracy of 0.9658
which is due to a phenomenon related to Byssinosis having a low
probability of occurring.

# Discussion

Nonparametric models are used when the assumptions needed for the model
arenâ€™t met. For generalized linear models, the big assumption that runs
the risk of being violated is the link function used is correct. Since
the residuals were normally distributed and the variance was homogeneous
throughout the model, we can assume that the link function is accurate,
and that there is no need to use nonparametric models. We used logistic
regression over linear regression because our variables were largely
categorical rather than numeric. In the case of workspace, there was an
undefined distance between classes meaning we could not use the same
techniques. One limitation of our model is that we only used forward
stepwise regression. We may have fitted a different model under backward
stepwise regression or a combination of both. Additionally, there may be
other variables that improve predictions of Byssinosis which were not
accounted for by the data. For example, the location of each worker as
well as any pre-existing conditions among workers.

# Conclusion

Although logistic regression is built on a Binomial model, the low
occurrence of the lung disease in the sample population (p = 0.03),
conditioned our model on the more accessible factor of absence of
Byssinosis (y=0) in workers. We were successfully able to outline risk
factors of Byssinosis in cotton factory workers through forward stepwise
binomial and poisson regressions using AIC and BIC criteria. Each model
overlapped on one factor, Workspace, referring to the level of dustiness
in a given factory. BIC for both regression models agreed on Workspace
as the only contribution variable, whereas AIC models overlapped on the
inclusion of Workspace, Employment and Smoking. Poisson regression
additionally included Sex as a contributing variable, where the Binomial
regression added an interaction term between Wrokspace and Employment.
Each model was trained on the same 80% training data, and upon fitting
the models and finding their confusion matrices, every model equally
demonstrated an accuracy of 96.59%. This result may be due to the
inability of our models to make predictions of class 1, or the
relatively low sample size for a prediction problem. Another explanation
for this phenomenon could be the convergence of Poisson and Binomial to
the sample model due to a constant in Byssinosis probability (p=0.03).
